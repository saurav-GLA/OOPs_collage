Given a string 
string = "Sanjay Datt"
s = 'a';
find the first occurance of a and print index

      String s = "Sanjay Datt";
        char s2 = 'a';
        int flag = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<s.length(); i++){
            int a = s.charAt(i);
            if(a == s2){
                System.out.println("Index = " + i);
                flag = 1;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(flag == 0){
            System.out.println(s2 + " not found in " + s);
        }


        //Output
        Index = 4





Two types of data types
1. Primitive 
2. Reference
                    ________
int s1 = "Tony;    | Tony   | 500  
                   | _______|


int s2 = s1;     s1 = 500  
                 s2 = 500
s1 and s2 both are storing the address of Tony not the string Tony 
and both s1 and s2 are refering to the address where Tony is saved
Therefore String is reference Data Type



if we create s3 = "Tony";
then also it is pointing to same tony stored at 500
but if s3 = "Stark"
then  Stark will be saved into new address
lets say Stark is stored at 600
then s3 will be 600 that means it is pointing towards Stark which is saved at address 600




s1 = "Tony"
s2 = "Tony"
if(s1 == s2) // True





but if we say 
s1 = new String("Tony");
s2 = "Tony";
if(s1 == (s2)) //False
because s1 is stored in new location and s2 is not pointing towards it
both stored value in diffrent places






if you want correct answer while comparing string it is preffered to use .equals()
like
if(s1.equals(s2))  //True

What will if we try to print
System.out.println("My name is " + 96); // It will not give Error
it will give  // Output
                My name is 96





         String s2 = "Hello World";
        int c = s2.lastIndexOf('a');
        //Give first occurace of a from last






.toUpperCase, toLowerCase
        String s2 = "Hello World";
        System.out.println(s2);
        String newS = s2.toUpperCase();
        System.out.println(newS);
//Output
Hello World
HELLO WORLD

       
        
        String s2 = "Hello World";
        System.out.println(s2);
        String newS = s2.toLowerCase();
        System.out.println(newS);
//Output
Hello World
hello world
